# Supermarket-Checkout-Simulation
Supermarket Checkout Simulation

Using JavaFx, I created a simulation for supermarket checkout that provides the following options:
• Include a minimum of two checkouts.
• Include of list of products that can be “scanned” with appropriate product code, description, and price.
• Enable items to be “scanned” using the product code.
• Keep track of the total cost of items “scanned” for each customer.
• Enable goods to be paid for in cash.
• Print out a list of items “scanned”.
• The facility to have more than two checkouts in the system i.e. an arbitrary number of checkouts.
• The facility to have different types of checkouts such as 10 items or less, cash only.
• Enable the system to keep track of total payments made by all customers.
• The facility to pay for goods by credit card.
• Stock control.

SOFTWARE DESIGN / MODELLING

I have developed four UML diagrams for the Supermarket Checkout Simulation, which include a Use Case diagram, 
Class diagram, Sequence diagram, and  activity diagram. The Use Case diagram includes different functionalities of 
the application such as User Interface, Checkout, Payment, Stock, Customers Transactions, and Print receipts. The 
Class diagram describes the various classes used in the application, including Shop, ShopController, StockDataValidation, 
StockController, CardCheckoutController, Transaction, Transaction HistoryController, and PrintinvoiceController, along with 
their respective functions. The Sequence diagram shows the flow of events in the application, starting with selecting items 
from the User Interface and ending with printing a receipt. Finally, the Activity diagram illustrates the steps involved in the sale, 
including selecting items, calculating the total, choosing a payment method, and printing an invoice.
